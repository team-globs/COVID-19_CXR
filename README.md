# DenResCov-19

A new deep learning classifier. The network consists of the existing DenseNet-121 and the ResNet-50 networks. We have observed in our study that in some instances DenseNet and Resnet have orthogonal performances; sometimes DenseNet performs better and sometimes ResNet. In our proposed model, we have created an extra layer with convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks to join these two models together to establish superior performance over either model for all characteristics, namely, recall, precision, AUC-ROC, and F1. The same strategy can be useful in other applications where two competing networks with complementary performance are observed.

Guidance for Installation:
